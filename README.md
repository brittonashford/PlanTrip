For this project, I wrote a React UI that allows users to plan a bus trip using data from Metro Transit's public API. I did my best to imitate the look of Metro Transit's NexTrip app.

To use the form, select a route, direction, and stop and real-time departure data will be displayed for your trip planning convenience:)

to run this app
1. clone the project
2. in the command line, navigate to the folder the project is located in 
3. run "npm i --force"
4. once the dependencies have been installed, run "npm start"


The NexTrip page this is based on can be found here: https://www.metrotransit.org/nextrip
