For this project, I wrote a React UI that allows users to plan a bus trip using data from Metro Transit's public API. I did my best to imitate the look of Metro Transit's NexTrip app (https://www.metrotransit.org/nextrip).

To use the form, select a route, direction, and stop and real-time departure data will be displayed for your trip planning convenience:)
